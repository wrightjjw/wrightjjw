What's up, I'm Josh!

I love making the world faster, better, and more fun.
Technology is a chore for most people to use,
but it should be both easy to use and effective at its designed role.
I put serious thought into the software I design to make sure it achieves both these goals
without overlooking either one.

I'm currently in my second year as a professional in the industry.
I've spent most of my time so far focussed on my company's work,
but now I'm looking to re-enter the world of Github and work on a side project or two!
I have some ideas cooking up in that head of mine,
so once I get some time I might just whip something up.

My work is in .NET, so I've been learning a lot about C# and associated frameworks!
Most of my work is Windows based, but I'm a Linux lover at heart,
so I love tools and apps that will work great on both.
(My [emacs config](https://github.com/wrightjjw/.emacs.d) is designed to be cross platform!)
Before starting my job, I did some learning and playing around with Rust,
which my [D&D tools](https://github.com/wrightjjw/dndtools) are written in.
I'm thinking about revisiting the language!

I'm also pretty interested in web technologies.
Web apps are really easy to use,
so I see a great future in many of these emerging technologies.
My work has gotten me interested in [Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor)!
I may end up using it for a project of my own someday.

That's all for now. This was last updated at the end of August, 2022.
