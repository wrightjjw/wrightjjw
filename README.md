What's up, I'm Josh!

I love making the world faster, better, and more fun.
Technology is a chore for most people to use,
but it should be both easy to use and effective at its designed role.
I put serious thought into the software I design to make sure it achieves both these goals
without overlooking either one.

I've been working professionally in the industry since 2021,
and while I don't like putting too much time into side projects,
there are some ideas and useful tools that I think would be fun to build!

My work is in .NET, so I've been learning a lot about C# and associated frameworks!
Most of my work is Windows based, but I'm a Linux lover at heart,
so I love tools and apps that will work great on both.
Before starting my job, I did some learning and playing around with Rust,
which my [D&D tools](https://github.com/wrightjjw/dndtools) are written in.
I'm thinking about revisiting the language!

I'm also pretty interested in web technologies.
Web apps are really easy to use,
so I see a great future in many of these emerging technologies.

That's all for now!
